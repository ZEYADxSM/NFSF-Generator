Fractal SVG Generator - README

This repository contains the source code, screencast, and report for the Fractal SVG Generator project. The purpose of this project is to read a custom file format (NFSF) and generate SVG graphics based on the provided instructions.
File Descriptions:

    main.c:
        Entry point of the program. Prompts the user for the input NFSF file, constructs the output SVG file name, and calls functions to parse and generate SVG graphics.

    screencast.mp4:
        Screencast demonstrating the code, its structure, and execution. The screencast runs for approximately 10 minutes.

    report.pdf:
        Report providing additional details, explanations, and insights into the code structure and functionality.

Building the Code:

to try any of the txt files, copy it and past it in the same file where the .exe file is.

Dependencies:

    This code relies on standard C libraries such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, math.h, etc.
    Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
