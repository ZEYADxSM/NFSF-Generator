Fractal SVG Generator

This project is a Fractal SVG Generator implemented in C. It takes input in the form of a custom NFSF (Nested Fractal Specification Format) file and generates an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) representation of the specified fractal figure.
Files

    main.c: The main C program file that orchestrates the fractal generation process.
    CS21120 report.pdf: A detailed report documenting the design, implementation, and analysis of the program.
    Fractal SVG Generator - README.txt: This readme file providing essential information about the project.

Getting Started

    Build the Program: Use a C compiler to build the executable from the main.c file.

    bash

gcc main.c -o fractal_generator

Run the Program: Execute the generated executable, providing the NFSF file as input.

bash

    ./fractal_generator input.nfsf

    View the SVG Output: The program will generate an SVG file representing the specified fractal. Open the SVG file in a compatible viewer to visualize the fractal figure.

NFSF File Format

The program expects input in the NFSF (Nested Fractal Specification Format) file format. Refer to the CS21120 report.pdf for detailed information about the NFSF file structure and syntax.
